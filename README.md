how it connects:
1) browser loads index.html and finds <div id="root>
2) mains.tsx --> mounts <App /> into #root
3) App.tsx --> renders app layout and import components
4) components --> provides reusable UI pieces to App.tsx


Further Updates and Enhancements-->

1. Persistent Storage Integration

Currently, your task tracker operates in-memory, meaning tasks are lost upon application restart. Implementing persistent storage using a database like SQLite or a JSON file can ensure data retention across sessions.

2. Task Prioritization

Introducing priority levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) for tasks can help users focus on critical tasks first. This feature is commonly found in advanced task management tools .

3. Due Dates and Reminders

Allowing users to set due dates and receive reminders can enhance task management. This feature is prevalent in modern task management applications .

4. Search and Filter Capabilities

Implementing search and filter functionalities will enable users to quickly find tasks based on keywords, status, or priority.

5. User Authentication

Adding user authentication can allow multiple users to have personalized task lists, improving the application's versatility.

6. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Developing a GUI using frameworks like Electron or a web-based interface with React can make the application more user-friendly.

7. Mobile Compatibility

Creating a mobile version of the app using frameworks like React Native or Flutter can expand your application's reach.

8. Analytics and Reporting

Incorporating analytics to track task completion rates and generate reports can provide users with insights into their productivity.

9. Recurring Tasks

Allowing users to set tasks that repeat at specified intervals can be beneficial for routine activities.

10. Dark Mode

Implementing a dark mode can enhance user experience, especially for those who prefer low-light interfaces.
